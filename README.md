# Amazon-sales-business-analysis 

 This project analyzes Amazon sales data using Pandas for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and MySQL for validating insights through business-driven SQL queries.
 Used pandas to explore sales, pricing, and customer behavior patterns and translate observations into specific analytical questions.   
 Validated key EDA findings using MySQL by writing structured queries with CTEs, window functions, and aggregations.
